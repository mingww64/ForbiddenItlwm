# BTLEAdvFixup

A Lilu plugin that lets macOS start Bluetooth LE advertising, which AirDrop needs, on an Intel Bluetooth controller.

- **Turn it on** with the boot flag `-btleadv`, and off with `-btleadvoff`. Without the flag it does nothing.
- **What it changes:** it patches `/usr/sbin/bluetoothd` in memory as its pages are validated, so `bluetoothd` takes its "extended advertising supported" path. It also adjusts some outgoing HCI commands, such as the random address of each advertising set, and does IntelBTPatcher's fix-up before the first scan. Nothing on disk changes.
- **One build per macOS version:** the Tahoe build's patterns match macOS 26.7.1 (25G241) and, from 0.8.1, 26.7.3 (25G342) and 26.7.2 (25G332), which shares 26.7.3's bytes, and the Sequoia build's (`tools/build_btleadv.py --target sequoia`) match 15.8.3 (24H241). On another build they don't match, and nothing is patched.
- **Before a macOS update, boot without `-btleadv`.** While the kext is active, reading `bluetoothd` returns the patched pages, and an incremental update that checks the file can fail.
- **Disable IntelBTPatcher.** Both hook the same function, and Lilu panics if two plugins do. BTLEAdvFixup takes over IntelBTPatcher's job.

Build it with `tools/build_btleadv.py`, as described in [docs/INSTALL.md](../docs/INSTALL.md).

## License

GPL-3.0-only. The HCI hook follows IntelBTPatcher (OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware, GPL-3.0), and the page hook follows BlueToolFixup (acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM). The full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- Tahoe includes four-operation tables for 26.7.1 (25G241), 26.7.2 (25G332), and 26.7.3 (25G342). The USB/HCI ordering workaround remains unconditional for supported Intel Bluetooth devices; page signatures simply match the corresponding bluetoothd build.
